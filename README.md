# Binary-search-tree-C-Sharp
Complete binary search tree with full functionality

Binary search tree is data structure where every node have one parent and maximally two child nodes (left and right). Time complexity of searching data in BST is log(N). Full functionality in this project is given with methods for measuring depth (or height) of binary tree, counting all of the nodes and method that delete given node.
